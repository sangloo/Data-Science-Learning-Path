My Path to learning Data Science and Artificial Intelligence:


----------


 - **[DataQuest](https://www.dataquest.io/profile/khalil.alami)**:  Best Website to learn Python, some basic data manipulation and machine Learning *done* 

 - **[Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/profile/khalilalami)**: To further polish Python and Overall Data Science skills + apply all the previous knowledge to R *wip*

 - **SafariBooks and [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/user/jiiokpjji/)** : Books are the best way to leran. That's why SafariBooks is for me the best learning recourse, unfortunately Books don't provide certificates and can't prove your capabilities so only useful once you get the basics done and want to Deepen your knowledge for your own self not to get a job. Udemy is also a very useful resource for video tutorials i use a lot, there is tons of content, some are great but others are really terrible.

 - **Udacity, Machine Learning + Deep Learning classes**: Probably the best machine Learning and Deep Learning resources Online, the price is quite high so i'm waiting to become an intermediate Data Scientist and get a job before starting those.

 - **Edx, Artificial Intelligence class**

 - **Udacity, Artificial Intelligence + Self Driving Cars + Robotics classes**:
